-- | Approximate the number of distinct values in a collection.
-- The way to use this is to start with @empty@ as the initial @State@
-- and then fold over a collection, taking a 32-bit hash of each element
-- and calling @insert@ to add it to the @State@. After all elements have
-- been added, @count@ computes the estimated cardinality.
--
-- Internally, this uses a variant of the hyperloglog algorithm. The @State@
-- is only 64 bits, which acts as 12 buckets with 5-bit counters. Since the
-- bucket count is not a power of two, we cannot simply take bits from the
-- beginning of the 32-bit word elements. So, we take them from the end and
-- leave them alone. This makes this variant unsuitable for computing
-- cardinalities above 256M. This implementation switches to linear counting
-- for small sets, which is common practice.
